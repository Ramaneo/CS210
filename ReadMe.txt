the code folder content (/codes):
pie_chart.ipynb:
visualizes individuals responses for every question and the demographics feature of individuals by using pie charts.
This code uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib and unidecode libraries.

decision_tree_model.ipynb:
the code used for the construction of the chart titled "Political Party, Gender, Educational Status, and question8='Yes' Relation" and the charts titled "The Answers of the Women(Men) to the 10th According to the Question to the Political Parties".
Furthermore in this code file there is the code of the decision tree model we created, the confusion matrix code and the codes that visualize the number of correct predictions using a bar chart.
This file contains matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.model_selection,sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.tree, sklearn .ensemble, numpy,mpl_toolkits.mplot3d,pandas libraries are used.

forest_tree_model.ipynb:
contains the constructor code of the forest tree machine learning model used, the code that created the confusion matrix, and a code that shows the number of correct guesses using the bar chart.
This file contains matplotlib,seaborn, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.ensemble, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.model_selection and pandas libraries are used.

data_prepation.ipynb:
there are codes that create bar and pie charts showing the demographic characteristics of the individuals in the file, and codes that create pie charts containing the demographic characteristics of individuals voting for akp and the proportions of their answers to the questions.

base.ipynb:
contains the code that shows the basic properties of the dataset using methods such as shape, describe.
In this code, numpy and pandas libraries are used.
 
charts_knn.ipynb:
there are codes that create histograms showing the answers given to all questions according to demographic characteristics and the constructor code of the KNN model used.
